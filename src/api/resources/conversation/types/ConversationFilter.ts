     * Full-text search query for matching conversations by content.
     * When you search with this parameter, you're performing a full-text search across all textual content
     * in the conversations, including both the user's messages and the AI's responses.
     *
     * This field also supports a syntax for advanced filtering the `metadata` and `tags` fields.
     *
     * Metadata examples:
     * - `metadata:myvalue` - matches conversations with any metadata field set to `myvalue`
     * - `metadata.mykey:myvalue` - matches conversations with a metadata field `mykey` set to `myvalue`
     * - `metadata.mykey:myvalue OR anothervalue` - matches conversations with a metadata field `mykey` set to `myvalue` or `anothervalue`
     * - `metadata.mykey:*` - matches conversations with a metadata field `mykey`
     * - `-metadata:myvalue` - matches conversations that do not have any metadata field set to `myvalue`
     * - `_exists_:metadata` - matches conversations that have any metadata field set
     *
     * Tags examples:
     * - `tags:myvalue` - matches conversations with a tag of `myvalue`
     * - `tags:myvalue OR anothervalue` - matches conversations with a tag of `myvalue` or `anothervalue`
     * - `-tags:myvalue` - matches conversations that do not have the tag `myvalue`
     * - `_exists_:tags` - matches conversations that have any tags field set
