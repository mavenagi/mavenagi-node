     * Full-text search query for matching knowledge bases by content.
     * When you search with this parameter, you're performing a full-text search across the knowledge title, tags and metadata.
     *
     * This field also supports a syntax for advanced filtering the `metadata` field.
     *
     * Metadata examples:
     * - `metadata:myvalue` - matches knowledge bases with any metadata field set to `myvalue`
     * - `metadata.mykey:myvalue` - matches knowledge bases with a metadata field `mykey` set to `myvalue`
     * - `metadata.mykey:myvalue OR anothervalue` - matches knowledge bases with a metadata field `mykey` set to `myvalue` or `anothervalue`
     * - `metadata.mykey:*` - matches knowledge bases with a metadata field `mykey`
     * - `-metadata:myvalue` - matches knowledge bases that do not have any metadata field set to `myvalue`
     * - `_exists_:metadata` - matches knowledge bases that have any metadata field set
