/**
 * Attachments can be created either with inline data (up to 5MB) using the `content` field or by
 * referencing an asynchronously uploaded asset using the `assetId` field.
 *
 * See the Assets APIs for more details on how to upload assets and get an asset ID.
 *
 * <Tip>
 *   Due to backwards compatibility, both the `type` field and the `name` field are present when attaching an Asset by ID.
 *   These fields will be ignored in favor of the values supplied during the initial Asset upload.
 *   They are only used for inline content uploads.
