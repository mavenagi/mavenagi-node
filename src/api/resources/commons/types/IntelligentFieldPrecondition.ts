 * A precondition based on the computed value of an intelligent field on the conversation.

 * the ID of the intelligent field (<referenceId, appId>).  Available
 * operators and the corresponding types of the RHS depends on the
 * validationType of the intelligent field.
 *
 * Note: in early beta, only opt-in apps and organizations/agents can
 * specify intelligent field preconditions.  Otherwise, the request will be
 * rejected.
